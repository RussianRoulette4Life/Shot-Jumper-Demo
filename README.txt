Well, time for smth usefull init?

/----------About the project-------------\
So this was my first somewhat serious attempt at programming
... something idk. I just found it quite interesting to write a game
and here we are. Everything is made by me with some debuging efforts from my friend. I really enjoyed doing it, but as of 24th of february 2022, i have some other stuff to study, like PyQt5's GUI capabilities, the 'requests' library and, at the very least, school. For now, this remains hibernated for the future me or, possibly, you
P.S. the code has literally zero comments cuz i never intended it to make it to github lmaooooooooooooo

/----------About the game-----------\
So its simple - you are a supposed robot on tracks who cant jump but has a rather cool ability to wield a gun, so you... use it, and jump around with it. Levels consist of tiles, which are scaled to fit the 128x96 grid system i pulled out of nowhere. 'lvl_settler.py' contains all the necessary methods to read and write to the file iconically named 'bruhsmth.txt'. As you can tell, im a 15 y.o. overflowing with the funny hormone, but thats beside the point. Pressing 'E' sends you to the edit mode, in which you can notice a block attached to the cursor moving by 8 px steps, just like i planned ;) Click the block to place there and write to the file its coordinates and type (every block for now is type 100, regular ground). Place the last block twice to properly load the last block and press 'E' again. Voila! You made a level! Tinker with my code all you want to write to other files. Also, im makin this free-source, the idea and even the code are free to use however you want, but be kind and credit to me (you wont use it what am i thinking huh).
